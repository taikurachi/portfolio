          GMB Fitness is a fitness company that focuses on helping people
          improve their mobility, flexibility, and strength through bodyweight
          exercises. Unlike traditional workout programs that focus on heavy
          lifting or intense cardio, GMB emphasizes functional fitness, making
          it ideal for individuals who want to move better, feel stronger, and
          maintain an active lifestyle without using gym equipment.

            I knew I wanted to incorporate gradients into my redesign. One
            company that utilizes gradients effectively is Stripe. After
            exploring their website, I admired their clean UI and how they
            seamlessly integrate gradients throughout their content. Rather than
            using a gradient overlay on an image, as GMB is currently doing, I
            decided it would be more visually appealing to apply the gradient
            over text or as a background element, avoiding a cluttered look. I
            also drew inspiration from Ramp’s video carousel layout, which I saw
            as a great fit for GMB’s design. Overall, GMB Fitness’s landing page
            lacked some aesthetic design elements, which I aimed to address in
            my redesign. I also wanted to focus on GMB’s brand appeal and what
            makes it different from other fitness programs.

            Through user research and personas, we identified that many of our
            users are former athletes or active individuals who want to move
            again but may feel held back by aches and pains. GMB is designed to
            be that friendly, approachable guide to help them start moving
            again, without the pressure or intensity of a complete fitness
            overhaul. To clearly differentiate GMB from traditional fitness
            programs, I strategically planned to place a dedicated section right
            beneath the hero banner that explains how GMB programs work.
          </p>

            replace the current thin headings with clear, descriptive ones that
            guide users seamlessly through the content, making it easier for
            them to quickly grasp what GMB offers. Additionally, I wanted
            emphasized GMB’s global reach, showcasing the number of clients and
            countries we’ve expanded to. This not only builds trust but also
            reinforces GMB’s credibility by demonstrating that it’s a proven
            product enjoyed by many across the world.

            Users should be able to understand what GMB offers within the first

            they can explore client success stories, showcasing real people who
            have benefited from GMB's programs, which helps build trust. From
            there, users can either browse the ‘Best Tutorials and Guides’ or
            visit the ‘Elements’ page for pricing and detailed information about
            the programs.

            An alternative flow allows users to learn more about GMB’s offerings

            video. After a set amount of time, the video prompts users to sign
            up with their email to continue watching, encouraging email capture
            while offering a preview of the program.

            I aimed to build trust in our science-based approach by giving users
            immediate value upfront. That’s why I included a snippet of our free
            20-minute bodyweight reboot video directly on the page. Users can
            watch the first five minutes to experience the quality of our
            content firsthand before being prompted to input their email to
            access the full video. This approach not only provides tangible
            value but also encourages users to engage further by signing up,
            creating a natural progression toward conversion. In the old design,
            users would have to sign up with their email before they received
            the free video, which could have deterred people from the start.
          </p>
          <p class="p-sm">
            In my redesign, I focused on improving the presentation of our best
            guides and tutorials. While the original design included these
            resources, it lacked an inviting and visually appealing layout,
            which made it harder for users to engage with the content.
          </p>
          <p class="p-sm">
            In the new design, I prioritized creating a more welcoming and
            visually stimulating experience. By utilizing simple icons, adding
            clear headings, and incorporating inviting imagery and visuals, I
            made the guides more accessible and engaging. This redesign allows
            users to explore the tutorials more easily, ultimately creating
            trust in the quality of our offerings and encouraging deeper
            engagement.
          </p>
          <p class="p-sm">
            The improved design helps users feel more comfortable and
            interested, contributing to higher retention and interaction rates
            with our content, and positioning them closer to making a purchase.

            After performing some usability tests with my prototype, I had some
            design feedback that included:
          </p>
          <ul class="p-sm dark-font">
            <li>
              Adding some simple animations to make the page more engaging
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide a more memorable graphic for “How GMB programs work”
            </li>
            <li>Being careful to include specific metrics</li>
            <li>
              Color code the icons for the “best guides & tutorials”. For
              example, make the background of “mobility” content pink
            </li>
            <li>
              Change some of the wording of the content to be more professional
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="p-sm">
            Based on the feedback, I made some adjustments to the prototype and
            presented it to the tech lead for approval. He approved the design,
            so I will now move forward with the development. Instead of
            migrating everything to the new design all at once, which would be a
            significant brand shift, I plan to implement the improvements
            gradually, updating the website component by component. I will use
            PHP, HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript to implement these designs.

            These are the three designs I prototyped. I knew I wanted to execute
            the two-column layout and have the hero image on the right,
            therefore, I chose to start off with prototypes instead of
            wireframing. Each design incorporates a gradient in some way. When I
            presented the prototypes to the tech lead and the CEO, they favored
            the third design for its simplicity. Since this was a design for a
            sales page template, a bold or loud layout could become repetitive
            if used too often. By keeping it clean and simple, we reduced the
            risk of the template feeling redundant. After receiving their
            approval, I moved on to the development phase using PHP, HTML, SCSS,
            and JavaScript.

            The CEO and tech lead asked me to use these designs as inspiration
            for the new mobile navigation. They emphasized the importance of
            highlighting call-to-action elements and creating a cleaner, more
            organized format for users to navigate the GMB website. With an
            increasing number of mobile users visiting the site, it became
            essential to design a visually appealing and highly navigable
            dropdown menu.

            incorporated CTA icons directing users to GMB programs, along with a
            red 'Save 40%' banner to prompt clicks on the Elements icon. Both
            layouts improved navigation and enhanced the brand’s
            professionalism. The CEO and tech lead preferred the second design,
            so I proceeded with developing the mobile navigation using HTML,
