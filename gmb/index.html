            After conducting a site audit and observing potential users navigate
            the site, I identified these pain points. For the redesign, I aimed
            to streamline the text and emphasize key areas that highlight GMB
            Fitness's value proposition. I focused on expanding GMB's brand
            aesthetics, incorporating gradients, pink, and blue tones. My goal
            was to create a design that allows users to navigate the site more
            naturally, avoiding confusion, while instilling trust the moment
            they land on the page.

            One company that effectively uses gradients is Stripe, whose clean
            UI enhances their professional appearance. Rather than using
            gradient overlays on images, I planned to apply gradients to text
            and backgrounds for a more aesthetic and cleaner look. I also drew
            inspiration from Ramp’s video carousel layout, which I saw as a
            perfect fit for GMB’s design. Both Stripe and Ramp make their value
            propositions easy to grasp at a glance, a goal I aimed to replicate
            by emphasizing GMB's unique brand appeal and improving its overall
            aesthetic.

            Through user research and personas, we identified that many of our
            users are former athletes or active individuals who want to move
            again but may feel held back by aches and pains. GMB is designed to
            be a friendly, approachable guide that helps them start moving
            without the pressure of a complete fitness overhaul. Users don’t
            need warnings about the dangers of inactivity or unnecessary text
            explaining how they NEED to move—they’d rather know how just 15
            minutes a day can revamp their body. They need a friendly,
            easy-to-navigate UI to understand and trust what GMB offers.
          </p>
          <p class="p-sm">
            To clearly differentiate GMB from traditional fitness programs, I
            strategically planned to place a dedicated section right beneath the
            hero banner that explains how GMB programs work. I planned to
            replace the current thin headings with clear, descriptive ones that
            guide users seamlessly through the content, making it easier for
            them to quickly grasp what GMB offers. Additionally, I wanted
            emphasized GMB’s global reach, showcasing the number of clients and
            countries we’ve expanded to. This not only builds trust but also
            reinforces GMB’s credibility by demonstrating that it’s a proven
            product enjoyed by many across the world.

            Users should be able to understand what GMB offers within the first

            they can explore client success stories, showcasing real people who
            have benefited from GMB's programs, which helps build trust. From
            there, users can either browse the ‘Best Tutorials and Guides’ or
            visit the ‘Elements’ page for pricing and detailed information about
            the programs.

            I aimed to build trust in our science-based approach by giving users
            immediate value upfront. That’s why I included a snippet of our free
            20-minute bodyweight reboot video directly on the page. Users can
            watch the first five minutes to experience the quality of our
            content firsthand before being prompted to input their email to
            access the full video. This approach not only provides tangible
            value but also encourages users to engage further by signing up,
            creating a natural progression toward conversion. In the old design,
            users would have to sign up with their email before they received
            the free video, which could have deterred people from the start.
          </p>
          <p class="p-sm">
            In my redesign, I focused on improving the presentation of our best
            guides and tutorials. While the original design included these
            resources, it lacked an inviting and visually appealing layout,
            which made it harder for users to engage with the content.
          </p>
          <p class="p-sm">
            In the new design, I prioritized creating a more welcoming and
            visually stimulating experience. By utilizing simple icons, adding
            clear headings, and incorporating inviting imagery and visuals, I
            made the guides more accessible and engaging. This redesign allows
            users to explore the tutorials more easily, ultimately creating
            trust in the quality of our offerings and encouraging deeper
            engagement.
          </p>
          <p class="p-sm">
            The improved design helps users feel more comfortable and

          <p class="p-sm">
            After performing some usability tests with my prototype, I had some
            design feedback that included:
          </p>
          <ul class="p-sm dark-font">
            <li>
              Adding some simple animations to make the page more engaging
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide a more memorable graphic for “How GMB programs work”
            </li>
            <li>Being careful to include specific metrics</li>
            <li>
              Color code the icons for the “best guides & tutorials”. For
              example, make the background of “mobility” content pink
            </li>
            <li>
              Change some of the wording of the content to be more professional
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="p-sm">
            Based on the feedback, I made some adjustments to the prototype and
            presented it to the tech lead for approval. He approved the design,
            so I will now move forward with the development. Instead of
            migrating everything to the new design all at once, which would be a
            significant brand shift, I plan to implement the improvements
            gradually, updating the website component by component. I will use
            PHP, HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript to implement these designs.
