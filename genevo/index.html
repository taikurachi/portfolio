            By researching competitors and companies in similar markets, we

            This was our user flow to get them to sign up for their consultation
            and provide us with their genetic data. It involved a step-by-step
            process that would be user-friendly and easy for the users to
            navigate. We wanted to integrate this user flow with a quiz-like UI
            that our competitors were using. By spreading out the options and
            lessening the cognitive load through progressive disclosure , we
            hoped that users would be more inclined to finish the quiz and
            provide us with their genetic information.

            To clearly differentiate GMB from traditional fitness programs, I
            strategically planned to place a dedicated section right beneath the

            Building on the collaborative ideas from our low-fidelity prototype,
            we refined the design to produce a polished high-fidelity prototype.
            In this version, we incorporated the brand’s color scheme,
            typography, and visual style more cohesively, ensuring alignment
            with GenEvo's brand guidelines. Interactive elements were enhanced
            to improve usability, with consistent visual feedback and smooth

            Based on the feedback we received, we iterated our prototype to
            address our users concerns and implement some of the features that
            were presented. We added more steps to the quiz so our users felt
            less overwhelmed. We changed the wording on the landing page. We
            also changed the hero image to a more friendlier one. We made the
            privacy notice more explicit and added a proper modal to display the
            text. We added an up-selling feature that allowed users to view
            other options for purchase.

          <h3 class="header-md">Reflections & Learnings</h3>
          <p class="p-sm">
            Through this project, I learned the critical importance of
            collaboration and communication when working with a team. Initially,
            we faced challenges in choosing a design strategy, as each team
            member brought unique perspectives and preferences to the table.
            However, we navigated these differences by accommodating each
            other's ideas, openly discussing our approaches, and reasoning
            through which options would best meet our project goals. This
            process of working through conflicting viewpoints not only led us to
            stronger design decisions but also taught me the value of
            flexibility and constructive dialogue in a collaborative setting.
          </p>
          <p class="p-sm">
            Effective communication was essential to coordinating our timelines
            and setting up regular meetings, allowing us to make steady
            progress. Iteration became a crucial part of our process—it allowed
            us to test and validate our design choices while addressing
            accessibility and usability issues early on. This iterative approach
            ultimately saved time and resources and gave us confidence in the
            effectiveness of our final solution.

          <p class="p-sm">
            The next step will be creating a mobile-responsive version of the
            design. It’s essential that everything designed for the web
            functions seamlessly across all devices and browsers. Additionally,
            we’ll focus on a smooth handoff to the development team. This
            includes gathering and organizing all assets, as well as documenting
            precise margin, padding, and layout dimensions to ensure accurate
            implementation.
